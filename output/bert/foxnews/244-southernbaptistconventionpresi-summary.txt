I love America and believe each citizen needs to be involved in charting the future of our nation|The blatant destruction of the family, the killing of unborn children, the continuing racial tension, the rebellion against authority, the ongoing reality of poverty, the rising threat of our security, the clear attacks against religious liberty and, of all things, the arrogance to believe the highest court in our land can rule on what the Bible says is genuine marriage testify to just how broken we really are|As a nation, we need to personally and collectively repent of our sins|We need to ask God for His free gift of forgiveness for the sins we have committed, resulting in change from that point forward|We need to return to God|There is no other|We need our churches to wake up|serving and influencing our communities with compassion and hope|Spiritual awakening is our greatest need in America today
