I wanted to like the movie because I love the book|I attended a pre-release screening with an open mind|The story of Louis Zamperini is one such story, but with an added dimension|the story ends there|Director Angelina Jolie attempts to put some flesh on the bones at the end of the film with some still shots and words that tell us that Zamperini's faith led him to return to Japan on a personal mission of reconciliation|That's a cliche|Nothing is "forced" when it is true
