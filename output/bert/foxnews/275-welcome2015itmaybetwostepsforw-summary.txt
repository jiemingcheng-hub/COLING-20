Today, January 1, 2015 is the very first day of a brand new year|And for many that means renewed efforts at a fresh start|This time we're really going to try|Try and succeed|One step back|I've been enjoying them more and micromanaging them less (one step forward)|due to a lack of discipline on my part, I've also allowed myself to be stretched too thin this past year and as a result, those I love most have suffered (one step back)|In some ways we get better|God's love for me, approval of me, and commitment to me does not ride on my resolve but on God's resolve for me|because Jesus succeeded for you, you're free to fail|Thank God!
