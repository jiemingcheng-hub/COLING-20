As the son of missionaries, losing my faith was no small event|That morning in his church I lost hope in the transformation that supposedly comes with faith|I reached the end of my story|Like many in my generation, the faith I'd lost inside the four walls of a church was found again through believers who left the sanctuary to help people in need|I was undone by a friend who listened without judgment|family problems and tragedy struck|their faith in God stumbled|they left the church|Little Hope Was Arson" ends with a quote from the Spanish anarchist Buenaventura Durruti:"The only church that illuminates is a burning church."
