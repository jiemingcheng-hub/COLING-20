There are a whole bunch of people who simply don't like Christmas and are fighting to get rid of it any way they can|I must admit, though, that I get irritated sometimes when a group of people bring a lawsuit to get rid of the town creche|I believe that the reason he came was to tell us that he isn't angry|Oh, yes I can," my friend said|he does it right well|At Christmas he decided to love and, then, clean up the mess later|So I think I'll opt out of the war|Happy Holidays
