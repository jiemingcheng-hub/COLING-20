The renewal of fighting this week over the Donetsk airport in Eastern Ukraine- an important symbolic target for Russian proxy fighters-- should come as no surprise|Why?|paying lip service to "modernization,"|The anti-corruption, pro-European revolution in Ukraine was presented as an American plot against Russia|Then came war in Ukraine -- aggression by proxy or, last fall, by uniformed Russian troops|The daily poisoning of Russian hearts and minds on state-controlled national television is now beginning to surpass even Soviet totalitarianism|Western democracies are portrayed as Russia's mortal enemies|This Stalinist-style propaganda is designed to justify the Kremlin's aggression against Ukraine, excuse increasing domestic repression, explain away mounting economic hardships and-- most troubling-- perhaps prepare the country for possible aggression against other neighbors
