As I read news reports detailing the Senate Committee Report on the CIA interrogation program after the September 2001 terrorist attacks|I concluded there are several recurring problems to this latest effort to govern our national intelligence agencies|when Williams explained to the Justice Department his plan to have Helms take the stand and recite all the covert programs that had been protected by various forms of prevarications by intelligence officials|President Ronald Reagan gave Helms the National Intelligence Medal as an obvious act of apology|But the intelligence world involves subtle issues|He told me he had come to regret he had been such a vigorous supporter of the gutting of that agency that followed the suggestions of the so-called Church Committee on which Mondale had served as a Senator|His comment was an isolated one and I merely listened|the effects of the Church Committee recommendations were damaging to the CIA|war is Hell|Any reforms of the intelligence universe cannot easily be effected
