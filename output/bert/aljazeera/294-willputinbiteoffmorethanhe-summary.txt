During a radio interview this week, French President Francois Hollande said Russian President Vladimir Putin "doesn't want to annex eastern Ukraine - he told me that"|As a former KGB officer, Putin probably looked into Bush's eyes and saw a case number!|The primary short-term goal for Russia in Ukraine will be to keep the conflict in eastern Ukraine "frozen"|This will be no easy task and will require the capture of important communication and transit nodes, such as Donetsk airport, the city of Mariupol and its port, and the Luhansk power plant|These are still under Ukrainian government control but are all needed if the separatists want to achieve true autonomy|it was the first city in Ukraine to recognise the Bolshevik takeover in 1917|Russia could be forced into creating a land bridge to Crimea|Will Crimea prove the same for Putin today?|One thing is for certain
