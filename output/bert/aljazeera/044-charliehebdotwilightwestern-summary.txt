Another horrific tragedy has struck a western capital in the violent murder of French journalists and cartoonists at a satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo|who were killed after a standoff with police on Friday|As with most incidents of violence involving Muslims, however, the ensuing public discussion has revolved largely around resolute vows to uphold a fundamental value of western civilisation - the freedom of expression - and degenerated into recriminations about Islam's purported assault on that very freedom|By positing western liberal claims to freedom against Islam's supposedly intolerant attitude towards irreverent or serious critiques of it would be to ignore completely the history underlying the current tensions|these provocative views cannot be separated from the broader political projects at work|Within Europe, western liberal ideals, whose proponents had never concealed their racist and exclusionary outlooks, could not avert the rise of a fascist movement in the mid-20th century|Even after the devastation of World War II, European appetites for destruction were seemingly unsatiated|that western governments take great care to prevent the spread of ideas and messages they consider culpable for radicalising Muslims|the state has consistently prosecuted writers, comics, and even cartoonists whose work was deemed to risk "disruption to the social order"|French Prime Minister Manuel Valls commented on the state's robust record of prosecuting artists saying:"Faced with this creativity of hate, should we do nothing?|Certainly not."
