I was born in July 1984|My sister would sometimes tell me things about that night|they started treating us badly|it was our brother Sunil, another survivor from our family of 10 - aged 13 at the time of the disaster - who decided to bring us back to Bhopal|Sunil refused to live with us in the orphanage, and got involved with the anti-Carbide campaign|I was happy with my life at the orphanage in Bhopal|We lost three sisters and two brothers along with our parents that night|I then asked her,"How did we survive?"|when he hung himself|I also had a pulmonary embolism in the US last year|It has been 30 years and justice continues to elude the people of Bhopal
