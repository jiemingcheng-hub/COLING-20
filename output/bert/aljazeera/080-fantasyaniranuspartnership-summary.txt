US Vice-President Joe Biden told an American university audience in October that Turkey, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are responsible for arming al- Nusra, ISIL, and other al-Qaeda-rooted extremists in Syria and that there is no "moderate middle" in the country|Predictably, there was no follow-up reporting in the New York Times reminding Americans that the US is itself complicit in funding and arming extremists in Syria|the groups with which he was affiliated were designated as terrorist organisations by the US State Department|Even the subsequent death of the US ambassador to Libya did not change US policy in this regard|Belhaj was just one of many al-Qaeda affiliates involved in violent anti-government campaigns in both Libya and Syria|these largely inconsequential US-led airstrikes are carried out in Iraq and Syria|some regional players continue to provide extensive logistical support to ISIL|In light of these realities, Iranians - who have been indispensable in preventing the fall of Damascus, Baghdad, Aleppo, and Erbil- simply do not buy the argument that a repentant US is now waging a real war against ISIL, the Nusra Front, and other extremist organisations in Iraq and Syria
