Ridley Scott's new movie "Exodus: Gods and Kings" has garnered much controversy over his casting decisions|critics have dismissed his reasoning|Exodus", whose budget before the tax rebates is estimated at $200m, would probably not have received the necessary financing if the lead actors were Middle Eastern rather than Hollywood A-listers|As such, there is nothing specific about "Exodus" that should single it out for criticism, besides being rather dull|can you recall Hollywood epics about ancient Greece or the Roman empire where the lead actors were Greek or Italian?|Mustapha Akkad's classics "The Message" (about the Prophet Muhammad and the birth of Islam), and "The Lion of the Desert" (about Omar Mukhtar, who led the Libyan resistance against Italian occupation), were headlined not by Arab actors, but by Anthony Quinn|In "Black Gold", the principal Arab leaders were played by Antonio Banderas (in Spanish accent) and Mark Strong|I could afford to make a big-budget film|We should all look at ourselves and say, 'Are we supporting wonderful actors in films by North African and Middle Eastern film-makers and actors?'|Some suggest that "people of colour" should have been cast as lead roles|It would be naive to think that race plays no part in Hollywood casting
