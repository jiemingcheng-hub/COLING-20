France lost five of its most prominent political cartoonists yesterday|These cartoonists felt there was no better way to fight fundamentalism than through derision and laughter|She later set conditions for taking part in the Republican march organised for next Sunday|A solidarity march gathering all religions and all sectors of the population in favour of freedom of the press does not play to her political hand|But they have failed to mention that Ahmed Merabet, the brave policeman who tried to stop the terrorists and was shot dead in the street, was himself Muslim and defended French Republican values through a lifetime of service in the police force|Mosques were reportedly shot at in Le Mans at midnight|Two years ago, her own father vehemently criticised Charlie Hebdo|after it ridiculed his political party|More importantly, Sarkozy can hardly support Charlie Hebdo and freedom of the press when he himself personally demanded the resignation of one of its cartoonists in 2008
