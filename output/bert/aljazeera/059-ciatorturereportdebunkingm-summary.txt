Last night, after months of delay, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) released a summary of their classified report on the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) post-9/11 Detention and Interrogation Programme|That's government-speak for torture|it was shocking|It was ugly|And it can never be permitted to happen again|To those behind the programme, the moral question was perversely inconsequential|In their representations to the White House, National Security Council, Department of Justice, Congress and the American people, the CIA often referred to Abu Zubaydah as "proof" that those methods provided real, actionable intelligence that saved American lives|There' s only one problem with that story|According to the SSCI report, the FBI actually obtained that information from Zubaydah through legal interrogation techniques between March and June 2002, and provided it to the CIA months before he was ever subjected to waterboarding or any other torture techniques|And that's pretty much it when it comes to "actionable intelligence" gained through the CIA's use of torture|Seriously?|As a longtime global leader in human rights issues, particularly on the subject of torture, the US has lost its moral credibility on the world stage|The first step in ending the torture programme was accomplished in 2009
