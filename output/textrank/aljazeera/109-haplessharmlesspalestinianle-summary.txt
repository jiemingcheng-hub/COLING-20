He speaks of his people's human rights. while his Palestinian Authority actively curtails them. Since Israel's last Gaza invasion, he also runs behind Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Elections that were due within six months never happened. he remains unchallenged. this has gone largely unnoticed. Human Rights Watch has documented "police beatings and arbitrary arrests of demonstrators", "excessive force", "repressing critical news reporting and demonstrations", "suppressing dissenting views", and "serious rights abuses, including credible allegations of torture". for which "no security officials were convicted". It certainly does not benefit the Palestinian people. This is nothing short of betrayal. A power imbalance alone cannot explain Abbas' policy choices regarding Israel.
