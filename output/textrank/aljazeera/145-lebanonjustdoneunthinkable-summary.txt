Imagine 12 million French in the UK today. Borders don't seem to mean much in this Middle East. they ever did. As a result, many refugees are living in terrible conditions. Syrians are indeed everywhere in Lebanon. In Beirut, and in every village and town one visits. How this will square with the new visa rules is unknown. No one will go to war. because they remember what war costs. because they know how little they derived from the devastation. Meanwhile, social and environmental erosion make the country less and less livable by the day.
