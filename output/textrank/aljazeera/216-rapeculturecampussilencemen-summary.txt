I got only one response. Across the board denial of any mistreatment of women seems to be the modus operandi of fraternities. One fraternity brother at UVA agreed to speak to me as long as I didn't use his name or identify his fraternity. I find this hard to believe. Stories of disrespect towards women at fraternities or elsewhere on campus abound not only at UVA, but nationwide. He was later recused from the case.
