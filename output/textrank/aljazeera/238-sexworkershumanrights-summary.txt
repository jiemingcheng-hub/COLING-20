The answer to these questions is controversial - both philosophically and politically. In New Zealand, where sex work is decriminalised, a sex worker won a case for sexual harassment against a brothel owner. In New York, 1,900 strip club dancers won a labour rights case against their employer. who will have to pay them at least $10m in compensation. - a goal that has proven difficult to reach. By increasing the cost of a sexual transaction, the law should work as a deterrent. So far, it is unclear whether France will go forward with the law at all. Germany is also working to reform its prostitution law. The Global Network of Sex Work Projects advocates "decriminalisation" of sex work. only New Zealand has chosen "decriminalisation" as sex work policy. maybe India will be next.
