Firstly, Al Jazeera broke the news that Iranian F-4 Phantoms were bombing ISIL in Iraq. Among the rumoured sites that were hit were areas of Damascus International Airport. Israeli officials meanwhile, would neither confirm nor deny the attacks with an Israeli army spokesman saying he would not comment on the "foreign reports". Israel's September 2007 attack on Syria's al-Kibar facility was again initially unconfirmed but would eventually be told as a strategic masterstroke taking down Syria's nuclear programme at a critical time.
