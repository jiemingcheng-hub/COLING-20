The BJP didn't shed tears. NDFB shot dead 50 Bengali-speaking Muslims in May. But the party's own poll campaign then underway accused Bangladeshi Muslims of"destroying" India. So the killings jelled with the BJP's political rhetoric; just days before the May butchery. Modi declared that Bangladeshis must keep their "bags packed" for deportation if he captured power. The party's Adivasi candidates, Rameshwar Teli and Kamakhya Prasad Tasa, trounced Congress MPs in Dibrugarh and Jorhat. In a sense Bodos were tempting fate for a long time. But security forces warned him that Maoists were capable of bringing down his helicopter!.
