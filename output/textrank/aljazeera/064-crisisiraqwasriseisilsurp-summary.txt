This seemingly counterintuitive alliance has its rationale and deep roots in history. The regime undertook demonstrative moves such as closing night clubs and some restaurants and enforcing restrictions on alcohol sales. A large scale Quran studying campaign was undertaken. In 1998, top-ranking party officials, including Vice President Izzat Ibrahim al- Douri, were openly demonstrating religious piety and devotion. The period after 1993 ushered in a renewed mosque building effort. By way of example, according to Decree No 59/1994 theft became punishable by amputation. This void has been filled by Islam. These include terms such as shu'ubiyya and safawiya. The same derogatory terms are also typical for ISIL propaganda.
