On January 6, Iraq will hold its annual Army Day parade in Baghdad. The views of Iraq's Shia community may be more complex. The Iraqi Ministry of Interior (MoI) fielded around 30 smaller brigades, totaling around 120,000 troops. The gap has narrowed between the two security ministries. (Three Peshmerga brigades or 15,000 troops will also be re-equipped under the programme) The Iraqi army can draw on some illustrious history.
