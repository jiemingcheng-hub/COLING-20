As far as my brother's death is concerned it was a waste. Whom are we poking fun at?. The terrorists or Muslims in general?. France is not at war against Islam and Muslims". No one should tell Muslims what they should or shouldn't get offended by. as it is up to them to determine it for their community. This is an issue involving all Muslims not only the terrorists. Who are we poking fun at?. It is not the powerful but the powerless that is the object of the laughter.
