Led by ex-Vice President Dick Cheney, former Bush administration officials have rushed to the airwaves to defend the CIA. Cheney & Co may not win the debate. they have succeeded in muddying the waters.

Torture produces a lot of information. victims frequently make things up to ease their suffering. they may also on occasion say things of some value.
