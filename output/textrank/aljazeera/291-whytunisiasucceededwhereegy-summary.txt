The coincidence couldn't be more striking. In Tunisia, the elements of the state, such as the interior ministry, remain bastions of the ancien regime. But the central issue today is precisely how the country built its post-Ben Ali leadership. The contrast with the Egyptian post-revolutionary leadership couldn't be clearer. There are many structural reasons why Tunisia has progressed politically while Egypt has seemingly returned to its pharaonic roots(as many commentators like to describe its penchant for authoritarian leaders). More broadly, human rights exists in a contradictory political framework.
