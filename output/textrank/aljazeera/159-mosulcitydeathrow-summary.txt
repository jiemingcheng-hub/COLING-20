Mosul remains under the black flag. The school system has been "ISIL-ed" with an education tax imposed, genders segregated and subjects such as art banned. Prayer and conservative appearance is strictly enforced. executions, even crucifixions, are commonplace. A smart strategy would seek to win Mosul from within. Residents of ISIL-controlled Raqqa have spoken of feeling like "strangers in their own city". Effective propaganda can help split Iraqi members of ISIL from their often foreign leadership.
