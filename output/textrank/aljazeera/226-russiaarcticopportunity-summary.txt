Russia needed a year-round ice-free port for its naval fleet. Imperial Japan saw this encroachment as a threat. Ice blocked the route along Russia's northern coastline. The fleet arrived knackered and ill-prepared for battle. Russia had no choice but to sue for peace. Each year more ships are making the journey through the Northern Sea Route. Most of these airfields will be refurbished Soviet era bases. others will be new.
