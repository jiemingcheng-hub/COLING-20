Some are no better than the Soviet-era communist rulers. It is not only their civic duty but for a Muslim politician it is their Islamic obligation as well. They hate extremism and violence, whether political or religious. They expect some competency and humility from their social and political leaders. This legacy may go back to their dark days under colonial "divide and rule". this can no longer be an excuse. The current blame game is meaningless. The demons must be slain. Islamists will also do better. they recognise that secularism is part of modern reality. Both groups consist of human beings and cannot be exterminated. Every citizen has a right to rule.
