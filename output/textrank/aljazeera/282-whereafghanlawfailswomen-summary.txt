Firstly, we started a lobbying campaign with those who opposed the law, mainly conservatives. We also organised exchange visits for conservative MPs to other Muslim countries so they could explore how these countries had been enforcing similar legislation for decades. In late 2009, there were only two issues left where conservative MPs did not agree. At this point, however, MPs became increasingly preoccupied with the then- upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for Spring 2010. the process lost momentum. Although the opponents were vocal. they did not outnumber the rest. What was damaging, however, was an unhealthy political rivalry that ensued among mostly female parliamentarians and supporters of EVAW. There were good reasons for seeking parliamentary approval. With the international community now gradually disengaging from Afghanistan, time is running out for Afghan women.
