Foreign aid spending has been cut by almost $3.7bn over four years. It is estimated that developing nations lose $160bn per year to corporate tax dodging; an amount that would end world hunger three times over. Aid is much more than a humanitarian gesture. it's a tool for regional development, trust and cooperation. Poverty breeds hopelessness and despair. which are both contributing factors to extremist behaviour. Wouldn't this money be better spent reducing inequality, poverty, and conflict?.
