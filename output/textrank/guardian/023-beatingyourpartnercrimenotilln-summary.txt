What stops a man from beating up and raping his female partner?. But there are other findings that give me cause for concern. What about prevention of domestic violence?. The research found that after DVPP, this behaviour changed "only marginally". Perhaps such programmes act as marriage guidance counselling and help keep couples together?. Is this not dangerous?. People who beat their partners are making a choice.
