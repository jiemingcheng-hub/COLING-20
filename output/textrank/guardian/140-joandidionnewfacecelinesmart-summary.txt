Was it by Celine or was it, as they say, model's own?. You don't buy that?. But it's not Didion's age that interests me. I could afford your gorgeous, minimalist gear. She is discreet, but never decorous. she is fierce, preternaturally observant and, sometimes, a little self-obsessed. And her clothes - unfussy, elegant, practical, a touch forbidding - reflect this.
