5bn a year. Last Wednesday, Andy Burnham, Labour shadow health secretary, launched Labour's public health strategy. So what's to be done?. In February 2010, David Cameron laid out his vision for "a new age of government". In 2013-14, the NHS budget was over ? 95bn, compared with only ? 1.8 bn allocated to Public Health England to promote "wellness". Andy Burnham calls this "finger wagging".  it is lifesaving. It makes sense.
