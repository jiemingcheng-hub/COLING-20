This made him even more attractive. Mal was a member of a then-notorious neo-Nazi organisation with a track record of serious criminal activity. He regularly turned up at whatever suburban park or abandoned house we found ourselves in. we sought to consume drugs and booze away from prying eyes. The more drunk we became, the more compelling his violent stories seemed. I was immediately hooked. The confusion that had been my constant companion, now viewed through this extremist lens, had suddenly become both figuratively and literally black and white.
