They refer to Islam to justify what they did. We condemn what happened in France. But it is not only westerners. In 2008 his magazine fired a cartoonist who made a joke about a Jewish link to President Sarkozy's son. I can understand why some might characterise it that way. Let's be specific: these are criminals exploiting Islam. Two recently published books reflect the atmosphere: very negative and very demoralising. We need politicians with more on their minds than winning the next election. I support free speech. It will be another example of targeting all Muslims.
