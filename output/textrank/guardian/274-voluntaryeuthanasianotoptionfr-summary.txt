Should Van Den Bleeken have been allowed to die?. But Van Den Bleeken isn't terminally ill and isn't in physical pain. Another argument turns on human autonomy. we should respect a person's free choices as long as they don't harm anyone else. Someone who is not terminally ill could still satisfy these requirements. He is heavily influenced by 18th century philosopher Immanuel Kant. Van Den Bleeken's victim was Christiane Remacle, a 19-year-old he raped and strangled in 1989.
