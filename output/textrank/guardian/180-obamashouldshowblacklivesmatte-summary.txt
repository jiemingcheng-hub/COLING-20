This of course will never happen. it's what I want. One police shooting victim's family member up in his box with a nice cop like Richmond, California Police Chief Chris Magnus(who famously held up a #BlackLivesMatters sign) is not enough. Erica Garner visits the site where two NYPD cops were killed to offer her condolences, she is saving the union. Skutnik helped save one woman.
