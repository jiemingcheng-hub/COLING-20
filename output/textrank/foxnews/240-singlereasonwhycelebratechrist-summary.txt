I could detail many true accounts of such glorious makeovers. I'll settle for telling you just one. We grandkids called her "Titi.". They ended up living in Southern California. She didn't obey. But that day, he witnessed something he couldn't believe nor explain. My grandfather stopped drinking and partying and began attending church. It's still standing. Then my mother Betty wouldn't have met my father Mariano. Merry Christmas!
