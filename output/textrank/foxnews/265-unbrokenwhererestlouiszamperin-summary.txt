I attended a pre-release screening with an open mind. Zamperini, who died earlier this year at age 97, came home an angry man. Yes, they can, but then why should they see a film that highlights only half a life?. Nothing is "forced" when it is true. His book is titled,"Don't Give Up, Don't Give In: Lessons from an Extraordinary Life.".
