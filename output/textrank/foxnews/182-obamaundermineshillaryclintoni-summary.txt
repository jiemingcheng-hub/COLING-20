Is President Obama trying to sabotage Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential run?. None of these messages works for Hillary. The issue is valid. The government raising wages will put people out of work. It's that simple. It's a tired song. They believe in growth, in optimism, in everyone getting ahead. Mr  Obama is not into compromise.
