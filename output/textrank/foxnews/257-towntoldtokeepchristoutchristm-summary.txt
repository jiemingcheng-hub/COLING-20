"We've got beautiful girls in Alabama," Mayor Bill Baker told me. We didn't think there would be any problems at all.". It was really wonderful and very moving to me to see people come together and praise God and speak His name out loud.". They're a pretty resourceful bunch. "It's a positive march. it's not a protest march. "They are infringing on my beliefs.". "The town has rallied," he told me. Miss Piedmont will be there - along with Miss Calendar. Merry Christmas, Piedmont. Thank you for keeping Christ in Christmas
