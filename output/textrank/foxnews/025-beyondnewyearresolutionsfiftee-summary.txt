This is a big one, but a really important one. Schedule an initial psychotherapy session. But suppressed anger can be more toxic. They may take you far from where you thought you were heading. And that's what life is like. Watch the movie "Miracle," with Kurt Russell. We keep sexual secrets. Let one out. See what happens. Stand up for someone else. I promise. Maybe at work. Don't delay.
