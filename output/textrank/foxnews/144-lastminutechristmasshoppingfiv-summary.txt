I'm sorry. Often last minute shoppers don't know what they want. Nobody likes that "January surprise.". Believe you still need "just one more" gift. We should all take a lesson out of Santa's playbook: 1. Make a list. 2. Check it twice. An attention-arresting display will attract last minute shoppers like honey attracts flies!.
